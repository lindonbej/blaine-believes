As we approach the General Conference[^1] marking the bicentennial anniversary of the First Vision, President Russel M. Nelson has invited us to reflect on what the Restoration means to us[^2]. I would like to share with you three things that the restored gospel has given me that have been particularly meaningful.

#### Faith in Jesus Christ

The restored gospel taught me about Jesus Christ and helped me have faith in Him. In a world where there is so much suffering, injustice and evil, it is wonderful to know that Jesus Christ knows our pains and that in time He will right all wrongs and heal all wounds. This knowledge gives me "hope for a better world"[^3] and helps me press forward in this one.

#### Personal Revelation

Joseph Smith described the religious scene of his day as a "war of words and tumult of opinions," and he noted that "it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong."[^4] Joseph Smith's experience resonates deeply with me. I have felt many times that I am lost in a tumult of opinions, with no way to tell right from wrong. The fact, then, that Joseph was able to get wisdom and revelation directly from God[^5] gives me hope that God will also help me find truth. I love that one of the central tenets of our religion is that everyone can have a personal relationship with God, and that God can communicate with each of us individualy.[^6]

#### Eternal Families

A key truth that God restored through Joseph Smith is that family relationships can go on into the afterlife.[^7] Now, I love my family, and my happiest memories are from spending time with them, so I love the thought of my family continuing forever. But this doctrine goes much deeper than that. Because of the restoration, we understand that God's essential role is that of a Father, and His work is helping us grow up to be like Him. Our destiny is to become like Him, and receive all of the blessings that He, the God of the universe, enjoys (which is mind-blowing when you stop to think about it).[^8] And we are to join Him in the work of bringing other souls to that same joy. This profound truth has had a great influence on my life. It leads me to prioritize my (future) role as a parent over my other life ambitions. And when I think of the magnificent future that God has in store for us, it gives me the courage to take the leap of faith that is required to following Jesus Christ.

I testify that I have felt God and His love. He loves all of us, and He will help all of us, if we are willing, to come unto Him through the grace and power of Jesus Christ. I testify that the First Vision is true, that Joseph Smith really saw Got the Father and Jesus Christ. I have felt it, and God has been guiding me ever since. I share this testimony with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!
