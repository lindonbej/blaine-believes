In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, individuals can be [baptized](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/baptism) starting at age 8, and most children who are raised in the Church are baptized soon after their 8th birthday.

I have spoken to individuals who believe that decisions such as baptism should not be made until adulthood. To a large extent, I am sympathetic to this belief. I certainly didn't fully understand what I was getting myself into when I committed to follow Jesus Christ as an 8-year-old, and it seems reasonable for such a big decision to not be made until one has a full grasp of its implications. 

But as I have walked along my journey of faith, I have realized that there will always be uncertainty and ambiguity in life. We will never have a full grasp of the implications of our decisions, especially in spiritual matters. An important part of our spiritual development is learning to make the best decision we can with what experiences God has given us, even though those experiences may leave some questions unanswered. Coming to this understanding has taken most of my 23 years of living. At multiple times I have made difficult spiritual decisions with imperfect information, but in each case, God has guided me and ultimately confirmed to me that I am on the right path. 

I testify that God is there and He loves us and desires us to come to know Him. All of our journeys to know God are different, but He is guiding each of us on our respective journeys, even when we don't recognize it. I testify of this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen!
