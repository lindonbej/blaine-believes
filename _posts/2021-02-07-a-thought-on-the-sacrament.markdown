Today is Fast Sunday[^1], which means I'm hungry. I was also hungry during our church services today, and so I very glad when the time came for the Sacrament[^2], because it meant I got to eat a bit of bread and have a sip of water. When you haven't eaten in a while, you really appreciate how much it means to have simple necessities like bread and water. I'd literally be dead without them. 

And that got me thinking. The bread and water of the Sacrament are symbols of Jesus Christ and how He sacrificed His life for our happiness. The thought occurred to me that, just as I need food and water daily in order to survive physically, I need Jesus and His grace daily in order to survive spiritually. 

Now, that wasn't really new information. I've known since I was five that I should pray and read the scriptures every day. I've been singing the hymn "I Need Thee Every Hour" for years. But my soul doesn't rumble as loudly as my stomach, and so sometimes I forget that it needs food too. I often let a day or two go by without saying a heartfelt prayer or taking time to study the scriptures. I often go throughout the whole day without giving Jesus much thought. And even though my soul doesn't rumble when it's hungry like my stomach does, I have noticed that I feel more disconnected from God when I don't take time to feed my soul.

So today was a good reminder of how important it is to take time each and every day to connect with God. I'm grateful for church, for the Sacrament, and for Fast Sunday. And I'm grateful that God inspired me with that little thought. And I should say that I am also very grateful for my wife, who pointed out that I haven't actually written in my blog in a long time. I've been so focused on revamping the website that I forgot to take time for the part that really matters.

That's my thought for today! I wish you a most joyful Sunday, and leave this thought with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!
