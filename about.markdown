## This Site

Hello! ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Blaine, and I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I've created this site to share my testimony, beliefs and experiences as a follower of Jesus Christ and a member of His Church. I hope this site will help you on your journey to come to know God. I also hope that it will increase your understanding of the Church if you would like to know more about it.

The idea to start this blog came from Clay Christensen in his book The Power of Everyday Missionaries. In the book, he describes how he created a website where he wrote articles describing his beliefs, so that when people had questions about his beliefs or the church, he could direct them to his thoughts on the website if there was insufficient time to discuss the topic in the moment. I hope this blog can serve a similar function.

Currently, I'm working on documenting my story of coming to know God over the last couple decades. You can find this under the "My Story" option in the menu. In the future, I will be writing a blog where I will share spiritual insights and essays on my beliefs.

As a disclaimer, I want to make it clear that the views expressed in this blog do not represent official Church teachings or doctrine. I'm human, and that means I make mistakes, and I hope that my mistakes will not be unfairly projected onto the entire Church and its other members. That being said, I will do my best to give explanations that are true to our beliefs, and I will make an effort to clearly distinguish between what are official Church doctrines and what are my own opinions.

Thanks for coming to my blog! Have a wonderful day!!!

## The Church

First and foremost, we believe in Jesus Christ. We believe what is taught about Him in the Holy Bible: we believe that He is the Son of God, and that He came to earth to teach us how to return to God's presence, and then sacrificed Himself to redeem us from our sins. After sacrificing Himself, He rose from the dead and returned to God's presence, overcoming death and making it possible for us to live again after we die.

We believe that God is our Heavenly Father. He loves us, and has a plan for our eternal happiness. He sent us to this earth as a necessary part of the process of achieving such happiness.

We believe that since the beginning of mankind, God has sent prophets and apostles to teach mankind about His plan and salvation through Jesus Christ. We believe that He continues to send prophets and apostles to teach His word in our day. Through these messengers, God has given us additional scripture that complements the Bible in teaching about salvation through Jesus Christ and God's plan for us. This additional scripture includes The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Currently, God's chosen prophet is Russel M. Nelson, and he is supported by two counselors and twelve apostles, who are also called by God.

Not only does God speak to the world through prophets, but He also speaks to us individually -- each of us can have a personal relationship with God. I testify that I have felt God in my life. I have felt His love, and I know that He loves each person on the earth. I invite you to learn more about Him and His Church. I leave my testimony and that invitation with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!
