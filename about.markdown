Hello! ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Blaine, and I'm a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist). I've created this site to share my testimony, beliefs and experiences as a follower of Jesus Christ and a member of His Church. I hope this site will help you on your journey to come to know God. I also hope that it will increase your understanding of the Church if you would like to know more about it.

The idea to start this blog came from Clay Christensen in his book The Power of Everyday Missionaries. In the book, he describes how he created a website where he wrote articles describing his beliefs, so that when people had questions about his beliefs or the church, he could direct them to his thoughts on the website if there was insufficient time to discuss the topic in the moment. I hope this blog can serve a similar function.

Thanks for coming to my blog! Have a wonderful day!!!

_As a disclaimer, I want to make it clear that the views expressed in this blog do not represent official Church teachings or doctrine. I'm human, and that means I make mistakes, and I hope that my mistakes will not be projected onto the entire Church and its other members. That being said, I will do my best to give explanations that are true to our beliefs, and I will make an effort to clearly distinguish between what are official Church doctrines and what are my own opinions._
