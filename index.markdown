I made this blog so I could share my testimony and thoughts on faith as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is my desire that what you read here will help you better understand Jesus Christ and His restored Church, and help you on your journey to know God for yourself. For more information about the purpose and organization of this site, see the About page.
