First and foremost, we believe in Jesus Christ. We believe what is taught about Him in the Holy Bible: we believe that He is the Son of God, and that He came to earth to teach us how to return to God’s presence, and then sacrificed Himself to redeem us from our sins. After sacrificing Himself, He rose from the dead and returned to God’s presence, overcoming death and making it possible for us to live again after we die.

We believe that God is our Heavenly Father. He loves us, and has a plan for our eternal happiness. He sent us to this earth as a necessary part of the process of achieving such happiness.

We believe that since the beginning of mankind, God has sent prophets and apostles to teach mankind about His plan and salvation through Jesus Christ. We believe that He continues to send prophets and apostles to teach His word in our day. Through these messengers, God has given us additional scripture that complements the Bible in teaching about salvation through Jesus Christ and God’s plan for us. This additional scripture includes The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Currently, God’s chosen prophet is Russel M. Nelson, and he is supported by two counselors and twelve apostles, who are also called by God.

Not only does God speak to the world through prophets, but He also speaks to us individually – each of us can have a personal relationship with God. I testify that I have felt God in my life. I have felt His love, and I know that He loves each person on the earth. I invite you to learn more about Him and His Church. I leave my testimony and that invitation with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!

I’m human, and that means I make mistakes, and I hope that my mistakes will not be projected onto the entire Church and its other members. That being said, I will do my best to give explanations that are true to our beliefs, and I will make an effort to clearly distinguish between what are official Church doctrines and what are my own opinions._
